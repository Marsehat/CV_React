## Practical Experience

This project was a practical experience converting [My_CV_Bootstrap](https://marsehat.github.io/My_CV_Bootstrap/) into a React web application. The original project was built using Bootstrap and has been restructured to leverage the component-based architecture of React for better maintainability and scalability.
